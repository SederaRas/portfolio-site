## **OVERVIEW**

This project focuses on finding the optimal location for a stakeholder interested in opening a Zumba Fitness Club in New York City, United States.

The stakeholder requested that **three key conditions** be considered when selecting the location:

\- **Avoid Saturation**: Identify neighborhoods that are not already crowded with fitness clubs or sports centers, with a particular emphasis on areas without an existing Zumba Fitness Club.

\- **Demographic Targeting**: Prioritize neighborhoods with a high percentage of Hispanic residents, provided the first condition is satisfied.

\- **Socio-Economic Considerations**: Focus on areas where the unemployment rate is acceptable, the average income is medium to high, and the average rent is reasonable.

## **DATA COLLECTION**

The data collection process for this project involved sourcing multiple public and external datasets.

\- *Neighborhood boundaries* were obtained from a geojson file from the Geodata Library of the University of California. The Centroid of each neighbor was calculated using the Shapely library.

\- The Foursquare API was utilized to extract *relevant fitness venues*, including gyms, dance studios, yoga studios, and other fitness-related establishments.

\- *Demographic data* such as the percentage of the Hispanic population was sourced from the Infoshare website,

\- The *socio-economic data* covering unemployment rates, median household income, and rent prices were extracted from New York Cityâ€™s housing and neighborhood data hub, CoreData.

These datasets were cleaned, processed, and integrated to facilitate the analysis and support decision-making.

The Neighborhood in this project was composed of 55 sub-boroughs within 5 boroughs.

## **DATA ANALYSIS**

### **Geospatial and statistical analysis**

To narrow down potential neighborhoods for opening a Zumba center, the first step involved using a **Choropleth map** to identify areas that met the first two conditions.

### **Clustering analysis**

**Clustering** techniques were applied to the results of the previous analysis to generate a list of the most promising neighborhoods based on the third condition.

## **OUTCOME**

The advantages of each area were outlined to assist in selecting the best possible location for the Zumba Fitness Club. The analysis yielded one potential neighborhood, **Jackson Heights**, meeting the specified criteria, enabling an informed decision on the final location.
