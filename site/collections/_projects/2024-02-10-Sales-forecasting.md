## A Comparative Analysis of Modern vs. Traditional Algorithmic Approaches to Sales and Profit Forecasting

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SederaRas/SALES_FORECASTING_PROJECT.git "Github Repo"){: target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"}

## Overview

Sales forecasting involves leveraging historical sales data and other relevant factors to predict future sales. Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for businesses, as it enables effective and profitable planning.

This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of both modern and traditional approaches to sales forecasting. Specifically, it will compare the predictive capabilities of a neural network model with those of a traditional linear regression algorithm and two ensemble techniques (XGBoost, Random Forest).

## Methodology

The project implement and assess these different models to determine which approach offers the most accurate predictions.

&nbsp;

## Outcome

The analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each forecasting method, guiding businesses in selecting the most suitable approach for their needs.

![Models Comparison](/uploads/picture-2.png "Models Comparison")

* For Business application purposes, the ***Neural Network algorithm*** on sales forecasting will yield an approximate goodness of fit of 90%. This is ***significant compared to a simple linear regressions.***
* NN compared to other sophisticated ML algorithms does perform better. However, XGboost delivers nearly the same performance on the predictions. Random Forest, slightly less but not by far. Additionally, both ***XGBoost and Random Forest are easier to implement and to interpret***.
* Conducting sale forecasting using Machine Learning is a powerful tool for Businesses to anticipate future demand and adjust their strategies accordingly.
